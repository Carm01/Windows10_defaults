# Import .reg files to user hive 

This is an AutoIT script designed to take an entire .reg file which you got from HCKU and import it into the default hive in order to save some time. It is VERY IMPORTANT that the .reg file entries be changed to match the name of the TEMP hive name. I recommend using __NotePad++__ to do a mass change. There are examples of a reg file and how you need to alter them the HKCU part

I have been having trouble pulling this off with a bat file currently, so I thought I would at least provide an alternate version if people are interested.
